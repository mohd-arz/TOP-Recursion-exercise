# TOP-Recursion-exercise

#### This exercise is a part of The Odin Project Curriculum.

##### Initially I wrote the merging algorithm by swapping the elements, that's where the new problem arose, I can't sort arrays where the length is Odd ex[2,3,4,5,1] but It sorts the Even Length arrays.

##### I didn't note that, but I need someone to review my code, by the feedback I came to realise it and also provided the solution for this problem.
